# Split-the-Bill

Is a webapp to help groups split bills with ease.

## Installation

Step 1: Install Node.js  

Step 2: Install Git Bash (Git SCM)

After the installer finishes, open git bash and run node -v to make sure node is installed correctly
If you don’t see some node version numbers display in your git bash window, restart git bash and try again
Step 3: Install Yarn Using .msi Installer

Once installed, open git bash and run yarn --version to see if you got Yarn working
If it’s not working, try restarting your computer and attempting the .msi installer link again
Step 4: Install Less

NOTE: You will see our commands have global in them. Please write the commands exactly as you see them. Globally installing packages is ideal for our situation. As you learn more about Yarn in the future, you will be using a lock file to control your packages, but for now, please use the global keyword.

Open git bash and run yarn global add less
If it’s not working, restart git bash and try again

## Usage
cd into your project on your local machine
Once you are in the root of your project run less-watch-compiler less css index.less

Open git bash and run yarn global add less-watch-compiler
